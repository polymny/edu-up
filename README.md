[![CI](https://github.com/polymny/polymny/workflows/build/badge.svg?branch=master&event=push)](https://github.com/polymny/polymny/actions?query=workflow%3Abuild)

This project consists in a backend written in
[rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and a front end in
[elm](https://elm-lang.org/).

## Building

The following sections explain how to build the client and the server.

### Getting the source code

The first step is to download the source code. There are two pieces of software
required for polymny:
  - [polymny](https://github.com/polymny/polymny): the polymny source code
  - [hls](https://github.com/polymny/hls): the script that encodes videos in
    HLS format for streaming

You need to clone these two repositories at the same level in your file system:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/polymny/hls
git clone https://github.com/polymny/polymny
```

### Client

You'll need to intall [elm](https://guide.elm-lang.org/install.html) in order
to be able to build the client.

We recommend that you install elm with
[nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation).

Once `elm` is installed, you should be able to run `make client-dev unlogged-dev`
in the
root of the repository to build the client.

### Server

#### External packages

Install the following package before rust compilation:

```
sudo apt install libpoppler-glib-dev qpdf imagemagick ffmpeg jq
```

You may need to remove the PDF line from `/etc/ImageMagick-<X>/policy.xml`
(where `<X>` is your image magick version) if an error occurs during the PDF
import.

#### Install Rust

You'll need to install [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
in order to be able to build the server. We recommend that you install rust
with rustup.

You have two tways to build the server:
  - you can simple run `make server-dev` at the root of the directory,
  - or you can `cargo build` in the server directory.

#### Database setup

The server requires a postgresql database. The best way is to create a postgres
user and a database for it. On most operating systems, you need to use the
postgres user:

```
sudo su postgres
```

Once that's done, you can create a user and enter its password like this:

```
createuser -P <username>
```

and then, create a database for the user:

```
createdb <dbname> -O <username>
```

You can then run

```
exit
```

to get back to your normal user.

#### Configuration

Once you've created the database, you need to write the configuration file.
This file should be in `server/Rocket.toml` and should define some parameters.
Here is an example of a minimal configuration file for development:

```
[default]
root = "http://localhost:8000"
video_root = "http://localhost:8000/v"

websocket_listen = "localhost:8001"
websocket_root = "ws://localhost:8001"

harsh_length = 5
harsh_secret = "XMmoJdfbnnI2ZQMz3wjp8itoSkngFoarFD4wiH6ZRaU="

secret_key = "eH/ZsKc5sJMD1/yr2HliA1XPlB3v6aT0Gv9pcRwQaYs="

[default.databases.database]
url = "postgres://<username>:<password>@localhost:5432/<dbname>"
```

The secret key and the harsh secret can be generated by running `openssl rand -base64 32`.
The harsh length is the minimum length of capsule ids which are hash ids.

Once the database is configured in the `server/Rocket.toml` file, you'll need
to install `ergol_cli` to initialize it:

```
cargo install ergol_cli
```

Once this is done, you need to run the migrations, which will create and
initializes the tables. Go to the server directory, and then run

```
ergol migrate
```

[You can find more documentation on ergol here](https://ergol-rs.github.io/)

#### Mailer configuration

If you want, you can also configure the mailer in the `server/Rocket.toml` file.
Doing so allows the server to send email, and thus, to verify users email.
Here is a template of mailer configuration:

```
[global]
mailer_enabled = true
mailer_host = "<smtp-server-url>"
mailer_user = "<user-for-smtp-auth>"
mailer_password = "<password-for-smtp-auth>"
mailer_from = "<from-header-of-email>"
```

## Running

Once you've built and configured everything, you just go to the server
directory, and you run `cargo run`.

## Developping

You can install `elm-live` and run `make client-watch` at the root of the
repository. When a change will be made to the client, `elm-live` will rebuild
the client, and it will serve a static server on port 7000.  However, this is
not what you want, you need to start the rust server by going in the server
directory and running `cargo build` or `cargo +nightly build`, and test on
[localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

The rust server will always serve the latest version of the static files, so
you don't need to restart the rust server everytime if you only modified the
client.
